# Day Two of 100 Days

This is day two of 100 days of Python coding. Beginner Stage

Will be learning about Data types, Numbers, Operations, Type Conversion, f-strings

Today's end project is a Tip Calculator

LESSON: in python, large numbers can be written with underscore seperating them.
For instance, Thirty million, three hundred and fifty-five thousand, five hundred can be written as 
300_355_500 
Python will interprets this in the real sense of using commas.

The programs created in this day 2 are:
1. Data_type.py : a program that sum the two digits of a given number
2. BMI_Calculator.py : calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person's weight and height
3. Life_in_Weeks.py : calculates no. of days, weeks, and months left if live till 90.
In python, the round() func is to round numbers to the required significant figure or decimal places
it is called round(a, b) where a is the number or the expression to be round, b is the number of places to round it

LESSON 2: print(5 // 2) gives a int instead of float as oppose to
print(5 / 2) which produce a float 2.50


LESSON 3: The f-Strings
the f-strings comes in front of a double or single quotes when making a string
It allows variables of different data type to be included in the string without throwing an error
Example: 
score = 30; height = 5.6, isWinning = True
print(f"Your score is {score}, your height is {height}, and you are 
winning is {isWinning}")
