    "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. It has been the industry's "
    "standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make "
    "a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, "
    "remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing "
    "Lorem Ipsum passages and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions "
    "of Lorem Ipsum.",

    "Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin "
    "literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney "
    "College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, "
    "and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubted source.",

    "The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections "
    "1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \'de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\' by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original "
    "form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham. It is a long established fact "
    "that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at "
    "its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, "
    "as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.",

    "Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, "
    "and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved "
    "over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). There are many "
    "variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in"
    "some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.  If you are going "
    "to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of "
    "text.",

    'All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the '
    'first true generator on the Internet. It use a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of '
    'model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is '
    'therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc. Lorem Ipsum comes from '
    'sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and'
    'Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the '
    'Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.',

    'An Igbo proverb tells us that a man who does not know where the rain began to beat him cannot say where he dried '
    'his body. The rain that beat Africa began four to five hundred years ago, from the "discovery" of Africa by '
    'Europe, through the transatlantic slave trade, to the Berlin Conference of 1885. That controversial gathering of '
    'the world’s leading European powers precipitated what we now call the Scramble for Africa, which created new '
    'boundaries that did violence to Africa’s ancient societies and resulted in tension-prone modern states. It took '
    'place without African consultation or representation, to say the least.',

    "Great Britain was handed the area of West Africa that would later become Nigeria, like a piece of chocolate cake "
    "at a birthday party. It was one of the most populous regions on the African continent, with over 250 ethnic "
    "groups and distinct languages. The northern part of the country was the seat of several ancient kingdoms, "
    "such as the Kanem-Bornu—which Shehu Usman dan Fodio and his jihadists absorbed into the Muslim Fulani Empire. "
    "The Middle Belt of Nigeria was the locus of the glorious Nok Kingdom and its world-renowned terra-cotta "
    "sculptures.",

    "The southern protectorate was home to some of the region\'s most sophisticated civilizations. In the west, "
    "the Oyo and Ife kingdoms once strode majestically, and in the midwest the incomparable Benin Kingdom elevated "
    "artistic distinction to a new level. Across the Niger River in the East, the Calabar and the Nri kingdoms "
    "flourished. If the Berlin Conference sealed her fate, then the amalgamation of the southern and northern "
    "protectorates inextricably complicated Nigeria’s destiny. Animists, Muslims, and Christians alike were held "
    "together by a delicate, some say artificial, lattice.",

    "Britain’s indirect rule was a great success in northern and western Nigeria, where affairs of state within this "
    "new dispensation continued as had been the case for centuries, with one exception—there was a new sovereign, "
    "Great Britain, to whom all vassals pledged fealty and into whose coffers all taxes were paid. 2 Indirect rule in "
    "Igbo land proved far more challenging to implement. Colonial rule functioned through a newly created and "
    "incongruous establishment of “warrant chiefs” —a deeply flawed arrangement that effectively confused and corrupted"
    "the Igbo democratic spirit.",

    "Africa’s postcolonial disposition is the result of a people who have lost the habit of ruling themselves. We "
    "have also had difficulty running the new systems foisted upon us at the dawn of independence by our “colonial "
    "masters”. Because the West has had a long but uneven engagement with the continent, it is imperative that it "
    "understand what happened to Africa. It must also play a part in the solution. A meaningful solution will require "
    "the goodwill and concerted efforts on the part of all those who share the weight of Africa’s historical burden.",

    "Most members of my generation, who were born before Nigeria’s independence, remember a time when things were "
    "very different. Nigeria was once a land of great hope and progress, a nation with immense resources at its "
    "disposal —natural resources, yes, but even more so, human resources. But the Biafran war changed the course of "
    "Nigeria. In my view it was a cataclysmic experience that changed the history of Africa.",

    "There is some connection between the particular distress of war, the particular tension of war, and the kind of "
    "literary response it inspires. \nI chose to express myself in that period through poetry, as opposed to other "
    "genres. My Biafran poems and other poetry are collected in two volumes—Beware, Soul Brother, Poems (which was "
    "published as Christmas in Biafra and Other Poems in America) in 1971 and Collected Poems in 2004. As a group "
    "these poems tell the story of Biafra’s struggle and suffering. I have made the conscious choice to juxtapose "
    "poetry and prose in this book to tell complementary stories, in two art forms.",

    "It is for the sake of the future of Nigeria, for our children and grandchildren, that I feel it is important to "
    "tell Nigeria’s story, Biafra’s story, our story, my story.\n\nI begin this story with my own coming of age in an "
    "earlier and, in some respects, a more innocent time. I do this both to bring readers unfamiliar with this "
    "landscape into it at a human level and to be open about some of the sources of my own perspective."

    "My father was born in the last third of the nineteenth century, an era of great cultural, economic, "
    "and religious upheaval in Igbo land. His mother had died in her second childbirth, and his father, Achebe, "
    "a refugee from a bitter civil war, did not long survive his wife. And so my father was raised by his maternal "
    "uncle, Udoh.",

    "It was this maternal uncle, as fate would have it, who received in his compound the first party of English "
    "clergy in his town. The new arrivals, missionaries of a new religion, Christianity, had already “conquered” the "
    "Yoruba heartland and were expanding their footprint in Igbo land and the rest of southern Nigeria with their "
    "potent, irresistible tonic of evangelism and education.A story is told of how Udoh, a very generous and tolerant "
    "man, finally asked his visitors to move to a public playground on account of their singing, which he considered "
    "too dismal for a living man’s compound. But he did not discourage his young nephew from associating with the "
    "singers.",

    "My father was an early Christian convert and a good student. By 1904 he was deemed to have received enough "
    "education at St. Paul’s Teachers College in Awka to be employed as a teacher and an evangelist in the Anglican "
    "Mission. He was a brilliant man, who deeply valued education and read a great deal - mainly the Bible and "
    "religious books, periodicals, and almanacs from the ChurchMission Society.",

    "My mother, Janet Anaenechi Iloegbunam, was an extraordinary woman. As a student of the legendary missionary and "
    "evangelist Miss Edith Warner she received a primary school education, which was a phenomenal feat at the time,"
    " especially for a woman. My mother joined my father on his travels through much of Igbo land to spread the gospel.",

    "My parents were among the first of their people to successfully integrate traditional values with the education "
    "and new religion brought by the Europeans. I still marvel at how wholeheartedly they embraced strangers from "
    "thousands of miles away, with their different customs and beliefs.",

    "It is from these two outstanding and courageous individuals that my five siblings - Frank, Zinobia, John, "
    "Augustine, and Grace - and I got our deep lovefor education and the pursuit of knowledge."

    "These days the origin of the universe is explained by proposing a Big Bang, a single event that instantly "
    "brought into being all the matter from which everything and everyone are made.\nThe ancient Greeks had a "
    "different idea. They said that it all started not with a bang, but with CHAOS.\nWas Chaos a god – a divine being "
    "– or simply a state of nothingness? Or was Chaos, just as we would use the word today, a kind of terrible mess, "
    "like a teenager’s bedroom only worse?\nThink of Chaos perhaps as a kind of grand cosmic yawn. As in a yawning "
    "chasm or a yawning void.",

    "Whether Chaos brought life and substance out of nothing or whether Chaos yawned life up or dreamed it up, "
    "or conjured it up in some other way I don’t know. I wasn\'t there. Nor were you. And yet in a way we were, "
    "because all the bits that make us were there. It is enough to say that the Greeks thought it was Chaos who, "
    "with a massive heave, or a great shrug, or hiccup, vomit or cough, began the long chain of creation that has "
    "ended with pelicans and penicillin and toadstools and toads, sea-lions, seals, lions, human beings and daffodils "
    "and murder and art and love and confusion and death and madness and biscuits.",

    "Whatever the truth, science today agrees that everything is destined to return to Chaos. It calls this "
    "inevitable fate entropy: part of the great cycle from Chaos to order and back again to Chaos. Your trousers "
    "began as chaotic atoms that somehow coalesced into matter that ordered itself over aeons into a living substance "
    "that slowly evolved into a cotton plant that was woven into the handsome stuff that sheathes your lovely legs. "
    "In time you will abandon your trousers – not now, I hope – and they will rot down in a landfill or be burned. In "
    "either case their matter will at length be set free to become part of the atmosphere of the planet. And when the "
    "sun explodes and takes every particle of this world with it, including the ingredients of your trousers, "
    "all the constituent atoms will return to cold Chaos. And what is true for your trousers is of course true for you.",

    "So the Chaos that began everything is also the Chaos that will end everything.\nNow, you might be the kind of "
    "person who asks, ‘But who or what was there before Chaos?’  or ‘Who or what was there before the Big Bang? There "
    "must have been something.’\nWell, there wasn’t. We have to accept that there was no ‘before’, because there was "
    "no Time yet. No one had pressed the start button on Time. No one had shouted Now! And since Time had yet to be "
    "created, time words like ‘before’, ‘during’, ‘when’, ‘then’, ‘after lunch’ and ‘last Wednesday’ had no possible "
    "meaning. It screws with the head, but there it is.",

    "The Greek word for 'everything that is the case', what we could call 'the universe', is COSMOS. And at the "
    "moment - although 'moment' is a time word and makes no sense just now (neither does the phrase 'just now') – at "
    "the moment, Cosmos is Chaos and only Chaos because Chaos is the only thing that is the case. A stretching, "
    "a tuning up of the orchestra ... \nBut things are about to change very quickly.",

    "From formless Chaos sprang two creations: EREBUS and NYX . Erebus, he was darkness, and Nyx, she was night. They "
    "coupled at once and the flashing fruits of their union were HEMERA , day, and AETHER , light.\nAt the same time "
    "– because everything must happen simultaneously until Time is there to separate events – Chaos brought forth two "
    "more entities: GAIA , the earth, and TARTARUS, the depths and caves beneath the earth.",

    "I can guess what you might be thinking. These creations sound charming enough – Day, Night, Light, Depths and "
    "Caves. But these were not gods and goddesses, they were not even personalities. And it may have struck you also "
    "that since there was no time there could be no dramatic narrative, no stories; for stories depend on Once Upon a "
    "Time and What Happened Next.\n\nYou would be right to think this. What first emerged from Chaos were primal, "
    "elemental principles that were devoid of any real colour, character or interest. These were the PRIMORDIAL "
    "DEITIES, the First Order of divine beings from whom all the gods, heroes and monsters of Greek myth spring. They "
    "brooded over and lay beneath everything ... waiting.",

    "The silent emptiness of this world was filled when Gaia bore two sons all on her own. fn1 The first was PONTUS , "
    "the sea, and the second was OURANOS, the sky – better known to us as Uranus, the sound of whose name has ever "
    "been the cause of great delight to children from nine to ninety. Hemera and Aether bred too, and from their "
    "union came THALASSA , the female counterpart of Pontus the sea. ",

    "Ouranos, who preferred to pronounce himself Ooranoss, was the sky and the heavens in the way that – at the very "
    "beginning – the primordial deities always were the things they represented and ruled over. fn2 You could say "
    "that Gaia was the earth of hills, valleys, caves and mountains yet capable of gathering herself into a form that "
    "could walk and talk. The clouds of Ouranos the sky rolled and seethed above her but they too could coalesce into "
    "a shape we might recognize. It was so early on in the life of everything. Very little was settled.",

    "Ouranos the sky covered his mother Gaia the earth everywhere. He covered Gaia in both senses: he covered her as "
    "the sky still covers the earth to this day and he covered her as a stallion covers a mare. When he did so, "
    "something remarkable happened. Time began.\n\nSomething else began too – what shall we call it? Personality? "
    "Drama? Individuality? Character, with all its flaws and failings, fashions and passions, schemes and dreams. "
    "Meaning began, you might say. The seeding of Gaia gave us meaning, a germination of thought into shape. Seminal "
    "semantic semiology from the semen of the sky. I will leave such speculation to those better qualified, "
    "but it was nevertheless a great moment. In the creation of and conjoining with Ouranos, her son and now her "
    "husband, Gaia unwound the ribbon of life that runs all the way to human history and our own very selves, "
    "yours and mine.",

    "Right from the start, the union of Ouranos and Gaia was gratifyingly productive. Twelve robust, healthy children "
    "came first – six male, six female. The males were OCEANUS, COEUS, CRIUS, HYPERION, IAPETUS and KRONOS . The "
    "females, THEIA, THEMIS, MNEMOSYNE, PHOEBE, TETHYS and RHEA . These twelve were destined to become the Second "
    "Order of divine beings, earning themselves a legendary name.\n\nAnd somewhere, as Time crept into being the "
    "clock began, the clock of cosmic history that still ticks today. Perhaps one of these newborns was responsible, "
    "we can look into that later.",

    "Not content with these twelve strong beautiful brothers and sisters, Ouranos and Gaia gave the world yet more "
    "progeny – two distinctive, but distinctly not beautiful, sets of triplets. The three CYCLOPES came first, "
    "one-eyed giants who gave their father sky a whole new range of expressions and modulations. The eldest cyclops "
    "was called BRONTES , thunder, next came STEROPES, the lightning, and then ARGES, brightness. Ouranos could fill "
    "the heavens with flashes of lightning and crashing thunder. He gloried in the noise and spectacle. But the "
    "second set of triplets Gaia bore sent even greater shudders through him and all who saw them.",

    "Perhaps it is kindest to say that they were a mutational experiment never to be repeated, a genetic dead end. "
    "For these newborns – the HECATONCHIRES fn2 – each had fifty heads and a hundred hands and were as hideous, "
    "fierce, violent and powerful as anything that had yet been released into being. Their names were COTTUS the "
    "furious, GYGES the long-limbed and AEGAEON the sea goat, sometimes also called BRIAREOS the vigorous one. Gaia "
    "loved them. Ouranos was revolted by them. Maybe he was most horrified by the thought that he, Lord of the Sky, "
    "could have fathered such strange and ugly things, but I think that like most hatred his revulsion was rooted in "
    "fear.\n\nFilled with disgust, he cursed them: ‘For offending my eyes, you shall never see light again!’ As he "
    "roared these furious words, he pushed them and the Cyclopes back into Gaia’s womb.",

    "\t\t\t\tGaia’s Revenge\n\nWe have good cause to wonder here what ‘he pushed them into Gaia’s womb’ really means. "
    "Some"
    "people have taken it to indicate that he buried the Hecatonchires in the earth. Divine identity at this early "
    "time was fluid, how much a god was a person and how much an attribute is hard to determine. There were no "
    "capital letters then. Gaia the Earth Mother was the same as gaia, the earth itself, just as ouranos, the sky, "
    "and Ouranos the Sky Father were one and the same.\n\nWhat is certain is that in reacting like this to the three "
    "Hecatonchires, his own children, and in treating his wife with such abominable cruelty, Ouranos was committing "
    "the first crime. An elemental crime that would not go unpunished.",

    "Gaia’s agony was unbearable and inside her, alongside the trio of writhing, flailing three-hundred-handed "
    "clawing and a hundred-and-fifty- headed butting Hecatonchires, there sprang up a hatred, a most terrible and "
    "implacable hatred against Ouranos, the son she had borne and the husband with whom she had given birth to a new "
    "generation. And, like ivy twisting round a tree, there grew a plan of revenge.",

    "The piercing pain of the Hecatonchires still gnawing at her, Gaia visited Othrys, a great mountain that looks "
    "down over what we now call the centralGreek region of Phthiotis. From its peak you can see the plain of Magnesia "
    "reaching down to the blue waters of the western Aegean as they curl round the Malian Gulf and embrace the "
    "sporadic scattering of islands called the Sporades. But Gaia was consumed with too much pain and too much fury "
    "to enjoy one of the world’s most charming views. On the summit of Mount Othrys she set to work fashioning a most "
    "unusual and terrible artefact from its rock. For nine days and nights she laboured until she had produced an "
    "object which she then hid in the cleft of the mountain.",

    "Next she took herself off to visit her twelve beautiful, strong children.\n\n‘Will you kill your father Ouranos "
    "and rule the cosmos with me?’ she asked each in turn. ‘You will inherit the sky from him and together all of "
    "creation will be our dominion.’\n\nPerhaps we imagine that Gaia – Mother Earth – is soft, warm, bountiful and "
    "kind. Well, sometimes she is, but remember that she banks down fire inside. Sometimes she can be crueller, "
    "harsher and more terrifying than even the wildest sea.",

    "And talking of the marine world, the first of the children that Gaia tried to win to her side were Oceanus and "
    "his sister Tethys. fn3 But they were in the middle of negotiating a share of the oceans with Thalassa, "
    "the primordial goddess of the sea. All of this generation were stretching and flexing their muscles at this "
    "time, establishing their areas of expertise and control, nipping, growling and testing each other’s strength and "
    "dominance like puppies in a basket. Oceanus had conceived the idea of creating tides and currents, which were to "
    "run like a great salt river around the world. Tethys was about to have his baby – no sin in those early days of "
    "course: propagation would not have been possible without incestuous couplings..... ",

    "....She was pregnant with NILUS , "
    "the Nile, and would go on to give birth to other rivers and to at least three thousand Oceanids or sea nymphs, "
    "attractive deities who moved as easily on dry land as in the waters of the sea. They already had two fully grown "
    "daughters: CLYMENE, who was the lover of Iapetus, and the clever and wise METIS, who is due to play a very "
    "important part in what is to come. fn4 The pair were happy and looking forward to life on the ocean wave, "
    "so neither saw any reason to help kill their father Ouranos.",

    "Next Gaia visited her daughter Mnemosyne, who was busy being unpronounceable. She seemed a very shallow, "
    "silly and ignorant being, who knew nothing and appeared to understand less. This was deceptive, for eachday that "
    "passed she got smarter and smarter, more and more well informed and more and more capable. Her name means "
    "‘memory’ (giving us the word ‘mnemonic’). At the time of her mother’s visit, the world and the cosmos were very "
    "young, so Mnemosyne had had no opportunity to prime herself with knowledge or experience. As the years passed, "
    "her endless capacity for the storage of information and sensory experience would make her wiser than almost "
    "anyone. One day she would mother nine daughters, the MUSES , whom we shall meet later.",

    "‘You want me to help you kill Ouranos? Surely the Sky Father cannot die?’\n‘Dethrone or disable him, then ... it "
    "is no more than he deserves.’\n‘I will not help you.’\n‘Why not?’\n‘There is a reason and when I know it I will "
    "remember it and tell you.’\nExasperated, Gaia went next to Theia, who was also paired off in another sibling "
    "union, to her brother Hyperion. In due course she would give birth to HELIOS the sun, SELENE the moon and EOS "
    "the dawn, quite enough parenting to be getting on with, so they too showed no interest in Gaia’s plans to depose "
    "Ouranos.",

    "Despairing at her pallid and unadventurous brood’s refusal to live up to what she imagined to be their divine "
    "destinies – not to mention repulsed by how loved up and domesticated they all appeared to be – Gaia next tried "
    "Phoebe, perhaps the most intelligent and insightful of the twelve. From the earliest age shining Phoebe had "
    "shown that she possessed the gift of prophecy.\n‘Oh no, Mother Earth,’ she said, when she had heard Gaia’s plan. "
    "‘I could take no part in such a plot. I see no good coming from it. Besides, I’m pregnant ...’\n‘Damn you,"
    "’ snapped Gaia. ‘Who by? Coeus, I bet.’\nShe was right, Phoebe’s brother Coeus was indeed her consort. Gaia "
    "stormed off with renewed fury to visit her remaining offspring. Surely one of them had the stomach for a fight?",

    "She called on Themis, who would one day be regarded everywhere as the embodiment of justice and wise counsel, "
    "fn5 and Themis wisely counselled her mother to forget the unjust idea of usurping Ouranos. Gaia listened "
    "carefully to this wise counsel and – as we all do, whether mortal or immortal – ignored it, choosing instead to "
    "try the mettle of her son Crius, who consorted with her daughter by Pontus, EURYBIA .",

    "‘Kill my father?’ Crius stared at his mother in disbelief. ‘B-but how ... I mean ... why? ... I mean ... oh.’"
    "\n‘What’s in it for us, mother?’ asked Eurybia, who was known as ‘the flint-hearted’.\n‘Oh, just the world and all"
    "that’s in it,’ said Gaia.\n‘To share with you?’\n‘To share with me.’\n‘No!’ said Crius. ‘Leave, mother.’\n‘It’s "
    "worth considering,’ said Eurybia.\n‘It’s too dangerous,’ said Crius. ‘I forbid it.’\nGaia turned with a snarl "
    "and sought out her son Iapetus.",
