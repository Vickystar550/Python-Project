tkinter layout manager:

1. the .pack() method:
    it takes default side argument of "top"
    others are: "left", "right", "bottom"

2. the .place() method:
    it takes the x and y coordinate of where to place the detail
    places it at that specific location i.e x, y
    x start from 0 to the maximum value of the tkinter.Tk screen width and vice-versa for y
    it is worth knowing that x and y is measured from the top left corner of the screen.
    i.e x if from top left corner towards to horizontal right
    while, y is from the top left corner towards the vertical (downward)

3. the .grid() method:
    takes kwargs like column and row value
    column specify the vertical position
    row specify the horizontal position
    both column & row are measured in the same way as x, y arguments in the .place() method
    N/B:
        this method is different from .place
        it split the screen into rows and column layout. That is like a grid..

N/B: you cannot use pack, place or grid in the same program. that is each program file uses the same layout manager
